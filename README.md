Covid Compliance Crowdsourcing


This is the bootstrap for a react-navtive project that would use crowdsourcing to let let the comminity report on business' covid complinance. Both so that businesses would be motivated to be in compliance with health and saftey rules but to steer frriends and family away from potential dangerious establishments.

A billion dollar idea that got in the way or having a job. I may be re-opening this project soon, both as practice and the ongoing need for such a service.
